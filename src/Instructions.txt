instructions for analyzing diffusion and relaxation data

1. unzip files into matlab working folder
2. add to path the relevant subroutines folder e.g. diffusion_semiparametric for diffusion analysis (but no others)
3. open and run the relevant run file e.g. run_diffusion_semiparametric_simulateddata.m. A data set will be simulated and analyzed using the model and fit parameters listed. 
The matlab command window will show the results of the fit, including the residual sum of squares, the distribution model components and their estimated parameter values as well as the associated standard deviation and confidence intervals (from Monte-Carlo error analysis)
Figure 1 shows the data, model fit, and residuals. Figure 2 shows the distribution. The height of delta functions (from single exponential models) are scaled by their component fractions.

To change fitting parameters, under the section %% model and fit and parameters, 
Increase number of fits as appropriate. 
Increase number of Monte Carlo repetitions for error analysis. 
Set type of model to one or a combination of the possible models listed, e.g, model = {{'gamma'}} uses the gamma distribution model. model = {{'stretchedexponential'}} uses the stretched exponential model.  Model = {{'gamma'}, {'exponential'}} uses a combined, gamma + exponential model.
Model parameters can be locked to a specific value or bound within a specific range, e.g., model = {{'gamma','beta',12}}; locks the parameter beta to 12. model = {{'gamma'}, {'exponential','D',[1E-9,1E-8],'theta',0.1}}; specified the diffusion coefficient value of the exponential component to be within 1E-9 and 1E-8 m^2/s, and specifies the fraction (theta) of the exponential component to be 0.1.
A baseline can be included (baseline=true) or not included (baseline=false)

To analyze your own data, comment out the section %%Simulate data set. Read in the data, e.g., 
b		= load('b.txt'); 
I		= load('I.txt'); 
(I is the signal intensity vector. For diffusion, b is in units of s/m^2. For relaxation, t is in units of s.)

If experiments were performed in TopSpin, you can use TopSpin T1T2 analysis to create matrices for input (instructions given below in the Preparation of Data in TopSpin section). Upon analysis with TopSpin T1T2, the files for input are created and stored within the experiment folder. The two necessary files are diff.xml and t1t2.dx. Copy these files from your experiment folder to your matlab path.
Add to path the folder io_bruker
Add the lines 
filename_dx    = 't1t2.dx';
filename_xml   = 'diff.xml';
experiment     = readdiffdata(filename_dx,filename_xml);
peakInd                     = 1; %specify the appropriate peak number
b                           = experiment.b{peakInd};
I                           = experiment.I{peakInd};
